# Note Taking App - Setup Guide

This README provides instructions on setting up the front-end and back-end portions of a note-taking application. Follow these steps to get both environments up and running.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main folders:

- `front-end`: Contains the user interface and front-end logic.
- `back-end`: Houses the server, API, and database management code.

## Setting Up

### Front-End Setup

1. Navigate to the `front-end` directory:

```bash
cd front-end


Install the necessary dependencies:

npm install


Start the development server:

npm run dev
```
### Back-End Setup
Navigate to the back-end directory:

cd backend

Install the necessary dependencies:
```
npm install

Start the back-end server:

npm run server
```

Usage:
The front-end part of the app can be accessed in a web browser at the address provided by the development server output.
The back-end server needs to be running concurrently for the front-end to interact with the API and database effectively.

Conclusion:

By following these instructions, you should have both the front-end and back-end of the note-taking app running locally on your machine. This setup allows for development and testing of the application's functionality.


This README.md content is structured to guide users through the process of setting up both the front-end and back-end environments of a note-taking application, detailing each step in a clear and concise manner.
